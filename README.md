Welcome to the Win-to-linux merge project.

"Win-to-linux merge? What is that?"
Win-to-linux merge is a project that aims to be able to copy user's contents from a windows NTFS drive to the linux ext4 drive.

"Lol what is the point? Can't I just do it manually?"
I mean... You can but this is really just for conviniance and project to contribute when bored. 

"You have other *more worth a while* Projects?"
Check my profile. There might be something more useful than this.
